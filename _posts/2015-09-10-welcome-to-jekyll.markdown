Hello World!

I am dedicating this post to briefly talk about jekyll, since I just finished installing it and using it for the first time. so What is Jekyll? You may ask. Simply put, Jekyll is a ruby based text transformation blog platform that is so much simpler and quicker to use than other bloated blog platform out there. *cough* wordpress. It works best in my user case as I am somewhat a minimalist and a semi-control freak. As an aspiring web developer, I love it that I can create posts in my favorite text editor using markdowns and html. On top of all the simplicity, I am deploying this blog via github free of chrage! 

Awesome sauce

I am leaving the pre-written blog post below as my future reference. 

=============

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
